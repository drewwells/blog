I apologize all of the code of my posts now is completely unformatted and missing syntax highlighting.  I have looked into the problem numerous times, and fixed it numerous times.  It usually involves removing and re-adding the plugin or doing other things.  I am now very annoyed there has been no update to the reason syntax highlighter will stop working after a few days, weeks.

I am looking for a new one, preferably one that will not break every couple of days.  I will have to go back through all of my posts and update the syntax to this new highlighter.

Don't use this plugin: <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/syntaxhighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter Evolved</a>
