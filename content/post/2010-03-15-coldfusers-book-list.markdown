I am throughly enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Design-Patterns-Recipes-Problem-Solution/dp/159059908X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1268702575&sr=8-1">Pro JavaScript Design Patterns</a>.  Much of JavaScript is a mystery to me and it does not help that despite calling itself Object-Oriented, it has one of the most convoluted implementations of Object-Oriented techniques.  Encapsulation is replaced by Closures and Inheritance is replaced by the prototype chain.

Coldfuser is hoping for some light at the end of the Coldfusion.
