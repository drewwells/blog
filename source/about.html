I work at the #1 Builder of manufactured homes in the country.  I specialize in developing web applications utilizing ColdFusion and jQuery in a WINTEL/SQL Server environment.  

My hobbies include running, frisbee, biking and swimming.  Hopefully one day I can include triathlons to this list.  I have written a few jQuery plugins for extending the functionality of our websites.  jQuery has really opened my eyes to the possibilities of JavaScript and hope to expand in this field in the future.  I am also trying to learn VIM for what must be the third or fourth time, I installed it at my work now so just that many more opportunities to use it.

Personal History:
I have been using computers ever since I can remember.  Age 5 I was playing in DOS tweaking ram availability to play DOS based games or operating Windows 3.11.  I have been an avid computer enthusiast all my life and have been building computers ever since I had the money to buy parts for them.

I did not get big into programming until College.  Participating in the Southeastern Regional ACM contest showed me why programming is such a rewarding experience.
