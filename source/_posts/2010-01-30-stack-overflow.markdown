I ended my paid for listings of my CV (as they call it ) at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/drew">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/drew</a>.  

The site is terrific (regular <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a>) and I did feel like giving them a bit of money was well worth the other things they do.  However, I have not been very happy with the traffic I am seeing on my CV.  It may be that the economy is slow and nobody is looking for resumes or it may be that <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow's Careers</a> has not picked up yet.  Whatever the reason, it seems that the time is not right for me to pay for listing my CV.  I will just hold off until another time.
