Looks like my wordpress settings file was hacked while I was fine tuning my Apache settings today.  Next time, I'll be sure to limit access to the server while doing server maintenance.  Attack looks pretty harmless some typos were entered in my wp-settings.php.  I changed my database passwords anyways just in case he read some stuff that I don't see in my access logs.
