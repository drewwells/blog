Looks like the spam bots and wordpress's automatic ping to <a href="http://pingomatic.com">pingomatic.com</a> have linked <a href="http://america.kicks-ass.net/blog/">Coldfuser</a> on Google.  I checked google right after posting and they had already sniffed my post from just minutes earlier.  I guess no surprize, Google does everything and does it fast, really fast.

My traffic is up 1,066.67% as well, I think the facebook plugin is mostly to thank for that.  Tricking all those unsuspecting people into reading another try post on Rails or other technically related issues.
