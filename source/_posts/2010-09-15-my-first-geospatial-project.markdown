Not sure why I never posted this.  I made a test project to get ready for my Geospatial job.  This is a simple mashup with <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>, Twitter, and Google Maps.

When I wrote this, the World Cup was still going on.  I included some of the stadiums in South Africa and a static list of Trending topics on Twitter.  The twitter birds may not work as these trending locations can change over time.  I didn't bother to use their trending locations availability service since WOEID to real LAT/LON transation wasn't readily available when I wrote this, so I had to manually translate all of the WOEIDs when I wrote this.
