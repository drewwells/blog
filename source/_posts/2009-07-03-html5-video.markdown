Have you seen the new video tag for HTML5?  FF3.5 and Safari 3.1 come with native video codecs to process videos directly.  Upon inspection of their demo page, I see that they have a single JavaScript file that detects support for this video tag or renders flash in place.  

Pretty neat: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fastest/">Fastest Firefox</a>, not to be confused with <a href="http://fasterfox.mozdev.org/">Faster Firefox</a>.
