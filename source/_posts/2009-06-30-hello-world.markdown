I got it working, there's much work to be done on the back end.  But after that I'll be able to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SMS</span>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">email</span>, and<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> mobile phone</span> to update my blog!  Okay, so none of those.  You just can't keep up with the big dogs, but who needs those when you got world wide access.
