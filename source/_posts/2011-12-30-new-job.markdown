I started a new job and haven't had much time to update the blog or various github projects.  Well actually I've had plenty of time to update these, but I haven't due to major data loss with my SSD.

As part of the job move, I have also relocated to Austin, TX.  It's been a pretty stressful move, but everything is in it's place now and I'm back on track running regularly.  Hopefully, I will be in great shape prior to the 115F summers here.

I have decided this year I will learn Erlang.  I will be somewhat starting over thanks to the SSD failure.  Going to a strict functional language is quite interesting.  I also end up spending hours and hours just to write 2 lines of code.  Erlang is pretty good at doing a lot of amazing things in just two lines of code, but it does take a while to get there.

Octopress has become very difficult to manage, I would have updated this sooner if I was still on Wordpress.

Peace out
